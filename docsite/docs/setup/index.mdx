# Setup Komodo

To run Komodo, you will need Docker. See [the docker install docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### Deploy with Docker Compose

- [Using MongoDB](./mongo.mdx)
- [Using Postgres](./postgres.mdx)
- [Using Sqlite](./sqlite.mdx)

:::info
Komodo is able to support Postgres and Sqlite by utilizing the [FerretDB Mongo Adapter](https://www.ferretdb.com/).

### First login

Core should now be accessible on the specified port, so navigating to `http://<address>:<port>` will display the login page.
Enter your preferred admin username and password, and click **"Sign Up"**, _not_ "Log In", to create your admin user for Komodo.
Any additional users to create accounts will be disabled by default, and must be enabled by an admin.

### Https

Komodo Core only supports http, so a reverse proxy like [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) should be used for https.
