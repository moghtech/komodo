# Deploy Containers

Komodo can deploy any docker images that it can access with the configured docker accounts.
It works by parsing the deployment configuration into a `docker run` command, which is then run on the target system.
The configuration is stored on MongoDB, and records of all actions (update config, deploy, stop, etc.) are stored as well.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
