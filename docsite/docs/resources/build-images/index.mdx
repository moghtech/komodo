# Building Images

Komodo builds docker images by cloning the source repository from the configured git provider, running `docker build`,
and pushing the resulting image to the configured docker registry. Any repo containing a `Dockerfile` is buildable using this method.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
